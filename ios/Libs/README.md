# Please put the `ZegoExpressEngine.xcframework` under this folder

The SDK `ZegoExpressEngine.xcframework` required to run the Demo project is missing from this Repository, and needs to be downloaded and placed in the `Libs` folder of the Demo project

> Run Demo directly, if the pre-compilation script detects that there is no SDK XCFramework under `Libs`, it will automatically download the SDK. You can also download it yourself and put it in the `Libs` folder.

Please unzip and put the `ZegoExpressEngine.xcframework` under `Libs`
